# 📦 Supply Chain Analytics Using SCM Dataset

This project explores real-world supply chain management (SCM) data to uncover insights into common practices, their effectiveness, and their impact on company performance. The analysis is conducted using Python for data cleaning and exploration, and Tableau for interactive visualizations.
