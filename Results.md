# 📊 Supply Chain Analysis: Key Findings

## ❓ Which supply chain practices (Agile, Lean, Cross-Docking) are most commonly used by companies?

**Answer:** Based on the dashboards I've analyzed, I can only provide a partial answer. I can determine the usage of Agile and Lean strategies through the "Defect Rates by SCM Strategy (Lean vs. Agile)" and other charts. 
* The "Defect Rates by SCM Strategy (Lean vs. Agile)" chart indicates the usage of Lean and Agile strategies. However, the data does not contain information on Cross-Docking.
* To accurately answer this question, the dataset would need to include a column indicating the adoption of Cross-Docking.

## 📈 How do different SCM strategies affect company performance metrics?

**Answer:**
The "Supply Chain Strategy Impact Dashboard" provides insights into this question. 
* **Agile strategies**, as I observe, show a tendency towards lower defect rates.
* **A higher number of strategies** is associated with reduced lead times and increased revenue.
* Companies categorized as **high-performance** (using both quality control and agile lead time) generate notably higher revenue.
* I see no strong correlation between the number of shipping carriers and shipping costs.
* Stock levels appear influenced by other factors beyond the number of strategies.

## 🔗 Is there a correlation between the number of SCM practices used and performance?

**Answer:**
The "Lead Time by Number of Strategies Used," "Stock Levels by Number of Strategies Used," and "Shipping Costs by Shipping Carrier Diversity" charts provide some insight.
* **Lead time**, as I see, tends to decrease as the number of strategies increases.
* **Revenue** tends to increase as the number of strategies increase.
* **Shipping cost** does not show a strong correlation with the number of shipping carriers.
* The **stock levels** are affected by other factors.

## 🧩 Are there clusters among companies based on SCM practices and performance?

**Answer:**
The dashboards I have do not directly visualize company clusters. To answer this question, I would need to perform further analysis using clustering algorithms (like those in Tableau or external tools). This analysis would involve identifying groups of companies with similar SCM strategy usage and performance patterns.

## 🤝 What SCM strategies are associated with high customer satisfaction?

**Answer:**
The current dashboards do not include data related to customer satisfaction. Therefore, I cannot answer this question based on the provided information. If customer satisfaction data were available, it could be compared across different SCM strategies.
